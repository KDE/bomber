		<para>
			&bomber; is a single player arcade game. The player is
			invading various cities in a plane that is decreasing in
			height.
		</para>
		<para>
			The goal of the game is to destroy all the buildings and
			advance to the next level. Each level gets a harder by
			increasing the speed of the plane and the height of the
			buildings.

		<title>How To Play</title>
		<para>
			The player is flying a plane in a city. The plane flies from
			left to right. Everytime it disappears off the side of the
			play area, it reappears on the left side again, but lower
			than it was before.
		</para>
		<para>
			The player has to destroy all the buildings to clear the
			level. If the plane crashes into a building, then the player loses a life
			and the plane is moved to the top left of the play area
			again.
		</para>
		<para>
			Buildings are destroyed by dropping bombs on them. This can
			be done by clicking the
			&LMB;
			or pressing the
			<quote>Space</quote>
			key. The bomb will fall from the plane and hit anything
			directly below it.
		</para>
		<para>
			After clearing a level, the player advances to the next
			level. Each level gets slightly harder than the previous
			level as the buildings get taller and the plane gets faster.
		</para>
