			invading various cities in a plane that is decreasing in
			height.

			increasing the speed of the plane and the height of the
			buildings.

		<para>
			The player is flying a plane in a city. The plane flys from
			right to left. Everytime it disapears off the side of the
			play area, it reapears on the right side again, but lowever
			than it was before.
		</para>
		<para>
			The player has to destory all the buildings to clear the
			level. If they crash into a building, then they loose a life
			and the plane is moved to the top left of the play area
			again.
		</para>
		<para>
			Buildings are destroyed by droping bombs on them. This can
			be done by clicking the
			&LMB;
			or pressing the

			key. The bomb will fall from the plane and hit anything
			directory below it.
		</para>
		<para>
			After clearing a level, the player advances to the next
			level. Each level gets slightly harder than the previous
			level as the buildings get taller and the plane gets faster.
